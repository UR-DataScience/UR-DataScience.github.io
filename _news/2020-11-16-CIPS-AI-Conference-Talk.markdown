If you are interested in building predictive models using Data Science Lifecycle, I will be presenting a session in [CIPS 2020 Professional Development Conference (AI – The Future Is Here)](https://sk.cips.ca/2020-professional-development-conference/) held by CIPS (Canada’s Association of I.T. Professionals). Registration is free for CIPS Saskatchewan members.

# Building Predictive Analytics Models using Data Science Lifecycle

People are curious about becoming a data scientist. You do not need to be a data scientist to start solving business problems using data science lifecycle.

In this talk, you will learn about what Big Data and Data Science could actually mean, and how you can solve an actual business problem and leverage the data science lifecycle to automate some decisions using machine learning models in Python.

## What will be covered in this talk:

**How to reframe a business problem into a data science problem**
* Step-by-step scenario following the data science lifecycle to solve a business problem
* Python sample code snippets for each step
* Learning about a simple machine learning model in details

This talk will be followed by a hands-on workshop in December 2020 that allows you to walk through a data science problem.
