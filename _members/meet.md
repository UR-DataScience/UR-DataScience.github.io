about: >-
    Final year Computer and Communication Engineering student at Manipal University, Jaipur.
    As a MITACS Globa link Research Scholar, 2021 with Data Science Lab, I am working on developing 
    new and optimized models for Federated Learning. As an undergraduate student, I have worked towards developing 
    practical solutions for real world problems.
